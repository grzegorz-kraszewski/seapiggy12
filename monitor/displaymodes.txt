SeaPiggy display modes

Unlike P96/CGX, which present huge list of modes of different resolutions,
SeaPiggy follows native modes style and offers only 5 different modes, defined
by number of physical monitor pixels constituting one logical pixel. Then
adjusting logical screen size to physical display size is done via overscan.
Modes are as follows:

1. "Low Res" -  one logical pixel is 4 x 4 physical. Nominal logical size is
320 x 256.

2. "High Res" - logical pixel is 2 x 4. Nominal logical size is 640 x 256.
